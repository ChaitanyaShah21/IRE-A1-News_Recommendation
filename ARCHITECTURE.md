## What we are building

A news-recommendation retrieval pipeline over two datasets, producing ranked candidate
articles for each impression, evaluated offline and submitted to two public leaderboards.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/newsrec/` | The package. All real logic lives here. |
| `src/newsrec/ingest_*.py` | Dataset-specific readers → one unified schema |
| `src/newsrec/retrieval/` | `popularity.py` (baseline), `bm25.py`, `semantic.py` |
| `src/newsrec/eval/` | Metrics, beyond-accuracy, slices, bootstrap, harness |
| `scripts/` | Thin command-line entry points; no logic |
| `configs/` | `mind.yaml`, `ebnerd.yaml` — no hardcoded paths anywhere in code |
| `tests/` | Includes `test_no_leakage.py`, required by assignment Q9 |
| `notebooks/` | `00_provided_*` are course-supplied reference. Ours only display results. |
| `data/` | Gitignored. Raw and processed data. |

## Decision log

Every choice, the alternatives rejected, and why. This section becomes the design note.

### D1 — Python package with thin notebooks, rather than notebook-first
**Date:** 2026-08-21 · **Decided by:** Chaitanya

**Chosen:** Real modules under `src/newsrec/`, command-line scripts, notebooks that only
import and display.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *Notebook-first, extract scripts near the deadline.* Faster to iterate, but extraction
  at the end is where reproducibility usually breaks — and Q1 explicitly grades a
  one-command rebuild.
- *Flat scripts, no package.* Simplest to read, but gets repetitive across two datasets
  with different file formats.

**Why:** The assignment requires `python build_pipeline.py` to rebuild everything from raw
files. Small named functions are also what make the code explainable step by step.

---

### D2 — Develop locally on small bundles, use cloud only for large test sets
**Date:** 2026-08-21 · **Decided by:** Chaitanya

**Chosen:** All development and debugging on MIND-small and EB-NeRD-demo, which fit in
the local 7 GB of RAM. Push to GitHub, pull into a cloud notebook for the large runs.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *Everything in cloud notebooks.* Simpler on resources, but hostile to a clean git
  history and a one-command pipeline.
- *Everything local.* EB-NeRD-large has 13.5 M impressions and there is no local GPU
  for computing text embeddings.

**Why:** Matches the assignment's own demo → small → large advice, and keeps a single
codebase that runs in both places.

**Open sub-decision:** which cloud platform. Deferred to Phase 5, to be decided against
measured memory numbers rather than guesses.

---

### D3 — Unified schema: three tables (articles, impressions, history), no separate users table
**Date:** 2026-08-21 · **Decided by:** Chaitanya

**Chosen:** `articles`, `impressions`, `history` — one row per user in `history`, built by
collapsing MIND's per-impression-repeated history string down to one row per user
(confirmed safe: MIND's history is fixed per user for the whole logging window, not
updated impression-to-impression — verified against `notebooks/00_provided_mind_analysis.ipynb`).
Demographic columns (gender/age/postcode/subscriber) stay as mostly-null columns on
`impressions` rather than a separate `users` table.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *Four tables, with demographics split into a separate `users` table.* More normalized,
  but Q4's required slices (cold-start vs. warm, head vs. tail) don't need demographics,
  and EB-NeRD's demographic fields are 97% null anyway — the extra join would mostly sit
  unused.
- *Two tables (`articles` + flat `impressions`), history duplicated inline per row.*
  MIND's native shape, but contradicts Q1.4's "small, reusable store" wording and
  discards the separation EB-NeRD's `history.parquet` already has.

**Why:** Matches the larger dataset's (EB-NeRD) native layout, keeps the store small,
and both datasets' impressions/history data map onto it without inventing structure
neither dataset actually has. [[unified-schema]] in `GLOSSARY.md`.

**Open sub-decision, deferred:** where article embeddings (EB-NeRD's provided vectors,
MIND's TransE entity embeddings) live — as columns on `articles` or a separate store.
Deferred to Phase 3 (Q3 semantic retrieval), since nothing before then touches embeddings.

**Column-level schema (concrete):**

`articles` — dataset, article_id (str, dataset-prefixed e.g. `"mind:N55528"` so the two
corpora never collide if ever concatenated), title, abstract (MIND's `abstract` /
EB-NeRD's `subtitle`), body (null for MIND), category, subcategory (null for MIND),
published_time (null for MIND), sentiment_score, sentiment_label, total_pageviews
(null for MIND, 87% null in EB-NeRD anyway), premium, article_type (null for MIND),
entities_raw (raw JSON string — MIND's `title_entities`/`abstract_entities` or EB-NeRD's
`ner_clusters`/`entity_groups`, kept unparsed until a phase actually needs entities).

`impressions` — dataset, impression_id (str, prefixed), user_id (str, prefixed),
timestamp, candidate_article_ids (list[str]), clicked_article_ids (list[str], empty for
unlabeled test rows), read_time, scroll_percentage, device_type, session_id (all four
null for MIND), split (added during the Q1.3 temporal split, not at raw ingest).

`history` — dataset, user_id (str, prefixed), history_article_ids (list[str]),
history_timestamps (list[datetime], null for MIND — MIND's history has no per-item
timestamp, only EB-NeRD's does).

**Judgment calls made without a separate decision point** (routine engineering defaults,
not results-changing — flagged per R6's own trivia exception, reversible if wrong):
dataset-prefixing article/user/impression IDs as strings even though EB-NeRD's are
native ints, and leaving entity annotations as unparsed raw JSON until a phase needs
them (YAGNI — You Aren't Gonna Need It, a principle against building things before
something actually requires them).

---

### D4 — venv + requirements.txt for dependency management
**Date:** 2026-08-21 · **Decided by:** Chaitanya

**Chosen:** Standard library `venv`, dependencies pinned in `requirements.txt`.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *Poetry + pyproject.toml.* Better lockfile guarantees, but adds a tool prerequisite
  (installing Poetry itself) before Q1.5's one-command rebuild can even start.
- *conda/environment.yml.* Better for non-Python binary/CUDA dependencies, but there's
  no GPU locally and nothing here needs conda's package resolution.

**Why:** Simplest path to Q1.5's "one command rebuild" — works anywhere Python does,
no extra tooling. `.venv/` is gitignored; `requirements.txt` is the only committed
artefact. Pinned exact versions (`polars==1.43.2`, `pyarrow==25.0.1`) — polars matches
the version already used in the provided notebooks, confirmed by installing it and
checking `pl.__version__`.

---

### D5 — Polars over pandas for all DataFrame work
**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Decided by:** inherited from constraints, confirmed with Chaitanya

**Chosen:** Polars everywhere — no pandas dependency anywhere in `src/newsrec/`.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *pandas.* The default choice for most people's first exposure to DataFrames, but
  single-threaded and eager-only. EB-NeRD-large's behaviors file has 12M+ rows on our
  7 GB RAM, no-GPU machine (`CLAUDE.md` environment facts) — pandas would need careful
  manual chunking to avoid exhausting memory, where Polars' `.lazy()` / `scan_parquet`
  does it by default.

**Why:** Not really an open fork — the assignment spec itself says "ensure your
prediction pipeline is memory-efficient (use Polars, PyArrow, or batch processing)," and
both provided notebooks already use Polars exclusively. Logged here for completeness
since it wasn't written down explicitly until asked about directly.

---

### D6 — Drop EB-NeRD's context `article_id` field from the unified schema
**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Decided by:** Chaitanya

**Chosen:** EB-NeRD's `behaviors.parquet` has a scalar `article_id` column, distinct
from `article_ids_inview`/`article_ids_clicked`, recording which article's page the
reader was already on when a recommendation module was shown (null for front-page
impressions — confirmed by its ~97.5% correlation with `scroll_percentage` also being
non-null, and that it's the *clicked* article only 0.5% of the time). MIND has no
equivalent concept. Decided **not** to add a column for it.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *Add a nullable `context_article_id` column to `impressions`.* Preserves the
  information for a possible future slice (on-article-page vs. front-page impressions),
  but nothing in Q1–Q9 needs it, and it would be null for 100% of MIND rows and ~70% of
  EB-NeRD rows.

**Why:** Nothing in the assignment's required retrieval, evaluation, or slicing logic
uses "which page was this recommendation shown on." Keeps the schema at D3's decided
size. Found while building `ingest_ebnerd.py` — not part of the original D3 column list
because this distinction wasn't discovered until inspecting real EB-NeRD data directly.

---

### D7 — Carve the test partition from dev/validation's tail, not train's
**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Decided by:** Chaitanya

**Chosen:** Neither dataset provides three labeled partitions at demo/small scale
(verified: MIND-small is train Nov 9–14 + dev Nov 15 only; EB-NeRD-demo is train
May 18–25 + validation May 25–Jun 1 only — both large-bundle test sets exist but are
unlabeled, Codabench-submission-only). Train stays fully intact; dev/validation gets
split into val + test.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *Carve test from train's tail instead.* Leakage-safety is identical either way — the
  choice doesn't affect correctness, only which partition shrinks. Shrinks train (the
  larger, more valuable-for-indexing partition) and requires re-splitting the file we'd
  otherwise leave untouched.
- *Skip a local test split entirely*, using validation for both tuning and final
  reporting. Doesn't satisfy Q1.3's literal "train/val/test" requirement, and repeatedly
  looking at the same validation numbers while tuning is a soft form of leakage through
  human decisions, not the model's.

**Why:** Maximizes train's data (BM25 index / retrieval quality depends on it directly),
touches only one file per dataset.

### D8 — 70/30 row-count split for the val/test cutoff, uniform across datasets
**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Decided by:** Chaitanya

**Chosen:** Sort the dev/validation partition by timestamp; the earliest 70% of rows
become val, the latest 30% become test — same rule for both datasets.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *50/50 split.* Leaves validation smaller relative to test than is typical — validation
  gets used repeatedly during tuning, test only once, so it usually deserves the larger
  share.
- *Day-count based per dataset* (e.g. "last 2 of 7 days" for EB-NeRD, matching the
  assignment's literal example phrasing). Doesn't apply evenly: MIND's dev is a single
  day, so it would still fall back to a percentile split anyway — two methods to justify
  instead of one.

**Why:** One rule, adapts automatically regardless of whether the partition spans 1 day
or 7. Verified against real data: MIND lands at exactly 70.0% val, EB-NeRD at 70.0% val,
and the core invariant (`train_max < val_min < val_max < test_min`) holds strictly for
both — this same check is the seed of the Q9 leakage test.

**Related finding, not a separate decision:** EB-NeRD's `train/history.parquet` and
`validation/history.parquet` genuinely differ per user (verified: user `95507`'s history
length is 370 in train's file, 326 in validation's — not the same data re-served). Since
val and test are both carved from the *same* validation file, both reuse that file's
history table unchanged (`temporal_split.add_history_split`) — the only snapshot
available at that granularity, and reusing it doesn't leak anything since it predates
the entire validation window, val and test both included.
