"""Q9: features unavailable at serving time, and what they would buy.

The assignment asks us to *"report metrics with and without features
unavailable at serving time"*. Note the direction: the point is not to remove
legitimate features, it is to **add an illegitimate one and measure how much it
inflates the score** - so the design note can say what a leak is worth here
rather than asserting that leaks are bad.

THE TEST FOR "AVAILABLE AT SERVING TIME"
Could this number have been computed at the moment the recommendation was made?
Not "is it in the file" - the file contains the whole logged history, including
things that had not happened yet when the impression was served.

  available    the user's click history before now, an article's text, its
               category, how often it had already been shown before now,
               whether this user has already read it
  NOT available how many clicks this article receives during the window we are
               evaluating, how long the user will read it, whether they will
               click at all

`future_click_counts` computes the second kind on purpose. It exists only for
this ablation and is named so it cannot be mistaken for a feature - nothing in
the pipeline imports it, and `train_click_counts` in `rerank.py` raises if it is
ever pointed at a non-train split.

THE CLEANEST ARM
`popularity` run twice, once from train-window counts and once from val-window
counts. Identical algorithm, identical candidates, identical everything except
whether the clicks it counts had happened yet. That isolates the variable
exactly, which no blended arm can.

BLENDING, AND WHY IT IS RANK-BASED
BM25 scores run 0 to ~40, cosine runs [-1, 1] and click counts run 0 to 4,316.
Adding them directly would let the widest scale win regardless of signal. Each
score vector is therefore converted to its within-impression rank, scaled to
[0, 1], before combining - which discards magnitude but keeps ordering, and
ordering is all the metrics read anyway.
