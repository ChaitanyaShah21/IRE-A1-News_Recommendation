"""Q4.3 beyond-accuracy metrics: intra-list diversity, novelty, coverage.

AUC, MRR and nDCG all ask one question - did the clicked item land near the top?
A system can answer it perfectly and still be bad. Phase 3's Finding 4 is the
worked example already in hand: MIND user `mind:U13132` read three political
stories and one about a Starbucks latte, and semantic retrieval returned five
Popeyes chicken-sandwich articles and nothing political. Every accuracy metric
would have called that a good list if one of the five was clicked.

READ THESE AGAINST ACCURACY, NEVER ALONE
A purely random recommender scores *best* on all three metrics in this module -
maximally diverse, maximally novel, near-total coverage. So these numbers do not
rank systems; they price what a system gave up. "Semantic wins nDCG@5 by 20% and
surrenders 40% of its diversity" is a finding. "Semantic has low diversity" is
noise. This is why D24's random arm is run through this module too.

WHAT LIST THEY ARE MEASURED ON (fork A, decided 2026-08-25)
Beyond-accuracy describes a system's *own* output. In re-ranking the platform
chose the items and we only reordered them, and only 6.8% of MIND's corpus
(19.2% of EB-NeRD's) ever appears in any val candidate list - so coverage
measured there is hard-capped by someone else's recommender, not ours. The
headline is therefore measured on the Q2/Q3 retrieval top-K, where our system
chose from the whole corpus. The re-ranking numbers are computed too, precisely
to show that cap rather than assert it.

WHAT `distance` MEANS IN DIVERSITY (fork B, decided 2026-08-25)
Both bases are reported. The conventional one is cosine distance between article
embeddings - but semantic retrieval finds articles by *maximising* cosine
similarity, so grading it in that space measures it by the quantity it exists to
minimise, and it loses by construction rather than by finding. Category distance
(18 categories on MIND, 25 on EB-NeRD, zero nulls in both) is independent of the
embedding space, so no method gets an automatic penalty.

The disagreement between the two bases is the actual diagnosis: a list that
scores badly on embedding distance but well on category distance spans topics
and repeats *within* them - which is exactly what the Popeyes example looks like,
and is a sharper statement than either number alone.

    The obvious implementation forms all k(k-1)/2 pairs. This uses a closed form

    unit length (semantic.py asserts that at load):

    against this on random data, so an error in the algebra cannot hide.

    p is the article's share of all training clicks, so a frequently-clicked

    **Laplace smoothing is not optional here.** 88.2% of MIND's corpus and a
    comparable share of EB-NeRD's were never clicked during training, and
    -log2(0) is +inf - which would propagate through every mean and make the
    metric useless without raising anything. Adding one pseudo-click to every
    article gives an unclicked one the largest *finite* novelty in the corpus,
    which is the right answer rather than a patch:

        MIND     floor 6.13 (most-clicked)   ceiling 18.20 (never clicked)
        EB-NeRD  floor 8.01                  ceiling 15.16

    Smoothing shifts every article slightly, so the range quoted here is the one
    the code actually produces rather than the textbook one.)

    Those ranges are worth carrying. Unlike diversity and coverage, novelty is
    **not bounded in [0, 1]** and its scale is a property of the corpus, so a
    raw novelty figure means nothing on its own and MIND's numbers are not
    comparable to EB-NeRD's. Same trap as AUC's sensitivity to candidate-list
    length in Q4.1: a metric that looks absolute and silently carries the

    any other split: novelty computed over val would be measured against the
