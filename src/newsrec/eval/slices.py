"""Q4.3 slicing: cold-start vs warm users, head vs tail articles.

A slice is an evaluation-time grouping, not a feature. That distinction sets the
one rule these definitions must obey: **a slice may use anything except the
labels it is used to evaluate.** Grouping impressions by whether their clicked
article was popular *among val clicks* would be circular - the grouping would
already encode the answer. Exposure counted from `candidate_article_ids` (what
was shown) is not label-derived and is safe, which is the same predicate
discipline D19 imposed on availability.

COLD START (D26, threshold = 5)
The two datasets barely overlap on history length:

    history length per val impression   p0   p10   p25   p50   p75   p90
       MIND                              0     3     8    19    42    77
       EB-NeRD                           5    37    94   225   400   604

EB-NeRD's *coldest* user has more history than MIND's 25th percentile. An
absolute threshold therefore selects 17.7% of MIND's impressions and 0.3% of
EB-NeRD's (55 of them) - and that asymmetry is the finding, not a defect. A
per-dataset quantile would produce equal-sized slices by making "cold" mean
<= 8 articles on MIND and <= 94 on EB-NeRD, two different concepts sharing a
label. EB-NeRD's cold slice is too small to carry a useful confidence interval,
which is reported rather than hidden.

HEAD VS TAIL (D26, two definitions)
The textbook definition - head = articles carrying the top 50% of *training*
clicks - is degenerate on news data. Measured: it puts **97.9% of val clicks in
the tail on both datasets**, because 88.2% (MIND) / 90.5% (EB-NeRD) of the
corpus was never clicked during training at all, and 39.7% / 94.4% of val
clicked articles were never clicked in training either. The catalogue turns over
between windows, so training popularity barely predicts what gets clicked later.

Exposure-based head - articles accounting for 50% of all val impression slots -
splits both datasets usefully (67.3% / 54.9% of clicks land in head). Both are
computed; the contrast between them is itself a result.

MULTI-CLICK IMPRESSIONS
29.3% of MIND's val impressions carry more than one click, and those clicks can
straddle a head/tail boundary. Rather than invent a rule (majority? first
click?), such impressions are assigned to neither slice and counted separately.
A stated default under the Phase 3 pacing agreement, not a silent one.
