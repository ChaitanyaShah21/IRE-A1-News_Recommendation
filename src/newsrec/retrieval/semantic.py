"""Q3.1 - article embeddings: text -> dense vector, stored in the feature store.

The lexical counterpart of this file is `bm25.py`, and the two are deliberately
parallel. BM25 represents an article as a *sparse* vector over the vocabulary
(65,238 x 60,951, 2.36M non-zeros). Here an article becomes a *dense* vector of
384 real numbers where no dimension has a name. Same corpus, same text fields,
different geometry.

Decisions this file implements:
  D20 - one multilingual model for both datasets, so Q3.5 compares methods and
        not setups. `model_type: "bert"`, which is one of the two families Q3
        names explicitly.
  D22 - vectors live in their own `embeddings.parquet`, one row per article,
        each vector beside its own `article_id` so the two cannot drift apart.
